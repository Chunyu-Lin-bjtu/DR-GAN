# DR-GAN: Automatic Radial Distortion Rectification Using Conditional GAN in Real-Time
## Introduction
This is official implementation for [DR-GAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8636975) (IEEE TCSVT'20).
> ### Problem
> Given a radial distortion image capture by wide-angle lens, DR-GAN aims to rectify the distortion and recover the realistic scene.
>  ### Features
>  * The first generative framework for the distortion rectification
>  * One-stage rectification (Compared to previous two-stage rectification: distortion parameter estimation -> rectification)
>  * Parameter-free (Directly learning the mapping between distorted structure and rectified structure)
>  * Real-time rectification (~66 FPS on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti and ~26 FPS on TITAN X)
